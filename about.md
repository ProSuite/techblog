This is a static blog generated using [Jekyll][jekyll]
and hosted at [GitHub Pages][ghpages]. The publishing source
is [github.com/ProSuite/techblog](https://github.com/ProSuite/techblog).

Blog articles “live” in this repository as markdown files
in the `_posts` directory. See any of the existing articles
to get started and beware that the “front matter” must be
present as the first thing between two `---` lines.

You may place your article in the `_drafts` folder;
here it can be committed to source control and will
be shown locally, but *not* published. Once ready for
publication, move it from *_drafts* to *_posts* and
give it a name conforming to the convention for posts.
